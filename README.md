# FT.S_GPIO
## Introduction
### About this repository
This repository is for Tensor FT.S_GPIO Add On Tel board, It contains Software, Hardware and example use cases for the tell
### Product description
Based on STM32F Cortex M0 CPU, Emulates COM port and enables the user to control and get recive the state of connected GPIO's

## Overview
### Highlights
* Implementation of USB to GPIO without the need for special drivers or deep system knowledge.
* Enables fast prototyping and fast time to market.
*	Can be used with popular coding language’s like Python
*	Open software and Hardware for even more flexibility
*	Build in bidirectional isolation based on ADM3260 chip.
*	Build in 4 Isolated GPIO’s expandable up to 20 with FT.V-TERM4
